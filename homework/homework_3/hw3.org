Problem 1) Evaluate the performance of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
#+end_quote

The CAPM results using python for my analysi for the Gibbons-Ross-Shanken test and and the Fama-MacBeth procedure are like this.

#+CAPTION: CAPM results for the 1963-07 to 1991-12 period.

We can interpret these results as following.

1. *Gibbons-Ross-Shanken (GRS) Test:*
   - The GRS statistic is 2.0171 with a *p-value of 0.0033*.
   - The null hypothesis of the GRS test is that the alphas (pricing errors) of all 25 portfolios are jointly zero.
   - Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we *strongly reject the null hypothesis*. This is strong evidence that the CAPM fails to explain the returns of the 25 portfolios.

2. *Fama-MacBeth Procedure:*
   - *Market Premium (mktrf):* The estimated risk premium for the market factor is statistically *insignificant* (p-value = 0.6167). The CAPM predicts this should be positive and significant. This is a major failure of the model.
   - *Intercept (Alpha):* The average intercept from the cross-sectional regressions is positive and *statistically significant* (p-value = 0.0228). A good asset pricing model should have an intercept of zero. A significant intercept indicates systematic mispricing that the model cannot explain.

Thus both tests reject the CAPM, and we have to conclude that the model does not sufficiently explain the cross-section of stock returns in this period.

Problem 2) Evaluate the performance of the Fama-French 3-Factor (FF3) Model and compare it to the CAPM.
#+end_quote

Overall, the Fama-French 3-Factor model performs significantly better than the CAPM and we can't reject it based on our data.

#+CAPTION: FF3 results for the 1963-07 to 1991-12 period.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 9cm
[[file:./ff3_mod_comp.jpg]]


1.  *Gibbons-Ross-Shanken (GRS) Test:*
    - The GRS statistic is 1.4581 with a *p-value of 0.0758*.
    - Since this p-value is greater than 0.05, we *fail to reject the null hypothesis*.
    - This means that means that adding the size (SMB) and value (HML) factors explains the pricing errors that were present in the CAPM and that the FF3 model is better in describing Asset returns than the CAPM.

2.  *Fama-MacBeth Procedure:*
    - *Value Premium (hml):* The estimated risk premium for the value factor is 0.43% per month and is *highly statistically significant* (t-stat = 3.03, p-value = 0.0026). This indicates that value is a priced risk factor.
    - *Size Premium (smb):* The size premium is positive but not statistically significant.
    - *Intercept (Alpha):* The intercept is now *statistically insignificant* (p-value = 0.1004). This is another sign of a well-specified model, as it shows that the three factors account for the returns, leaving no significant unexplained portion.


Thus we can see that the FF3 model is not rejected by the GRS test, and also produces a non-significant alpha. Furthermore it identifies the value factor (HML) as a significant source of priced risk in the cross-section of stock returns.

Problem 3) Discuss the effect of using different standard error corrections (Newey-West, Shanken).
#+end_quote
- *Newey-West:* The Newey-West correction accounts for autocorrelation in the lambda time series. For both models, this correction slightly *increases* the standard errors and thus *lowers* the t-statistics. For example, in the FF3 model, the t-statistic for HML drops from 3.03 to 2.59, but remains highly statically significant. This suggests some autocorrelation is present, but it does not change the main conclusions.
- *Shanken Correction:* The Shanken correction accounts for the fact that the betas used in the second pass are estimated with error. This correction also slightly *increases* the standard errors. For example, the t-statistic for HML in the FF3 model drops from 3.03 to 2.96. Again, the change is minor and does not alter the conclusion that HML is a priced factor.

These are the results for if we do the corrections for the CAPM for the first period (1963-1991)

and these are the results when doing the corrections for the FF3 model in the same period.

#+CAPTION: Corrected standard errors for FF3, first period.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 9cm
[[file:./comp_ff3_first_period.jpg]]

Repeating the earlier point, we can see that although the standard erros (and thus p-values and t-staticics) change, they do not influence the results we found in the previous two questions.


#+begin_quote
Problem 4) How do the models perform over the full sample period?
#+end_quote

Over the full sample we find that both models perform poorly especially according to the GRS test

These are the results for the CAPM over the full sample.

#+CAPTION: Results for the CAPM model, full sample.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 9cm
[[file:./capm_full.jpg]]

And here are the results for FF3 model over the full sample.

#+CAPTION: Results for the FF3 model, full sample.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 9cm
[[file:./ff3_full_sample.jpg]]

We can see that the CAPM is still performing poorly with both procedures. Furthermore we see that the FF3 model also starts to falter.
The intercept is now statistically significant. SMB stayed statisticially insignificant. HML did stay statistically significant, which is good, but
=mktrf=, the market factor, actually switched signs.

I also conducted the Newey-West procedure and the Shanken Correction to see what would happen, because I thought it might make the mktrf coefficient at least be insignificant, however even with the adjusted standard errors, the results don't change.
