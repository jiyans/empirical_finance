Problem 1) The CSV files =df_long_NYSE.csv= and =df_long_NASDAQ.csv= on Canvas contain monthly
individual stock data on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ (Global
Select), respectively. They were downloaded using the Python program,
=a1_download_prices.py.= It obtains ticker symbols available at the time of running from
the following URL:
a) NYSE: https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/symdir/otherlisted.txt
b) NASDAQ: https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/symdir/nasdaqlisted.txt
c) Compute returns as the relative change in closing price (Close) from the previous day.
The first return on each stock should be missing. Do not fill missing returns with zero.
#+end_quote

Here are the calculated returns for problem 2. We check that the first number for all symbols is missing.

Problem 2. Implement Momentum Strategy and Form Portfolios
#+end_quote

Next, we get the momentum portfolios. We get them in the code, but for ease of viewing I will only show the returns of the decile portfolios.

[[attachment:nyse_portfolios.jpg]]

Next are the nasdaq portfolios

Problem 3. Analyze and Tabulate Results
#+end_quote

These are the nyse analysis results (Mean return and t-values)
[[attachment:nyse_analysis_results.jpg]]

jAnd here are the nasdaq analysis results.
[[attachment:nasdaq_analysis_results.jpg]]


Also for a check, here are the bar plots for the avg number of stocks in the portfolios
NYSE:

NASDAQ

#+begin_quote
Problem 4. Compare NYSE and NASDAQ
#+end_quote


Calculate the difference in returns between the corresponding deciles and test if the difference is statistically significant.


[[attachment:diff.jpg]]

1. *Statistical Significance*:
   - All deciles in both markets show statistically significant returns (p-values < 0.05)
   - The t-statistics are generally strong (>2) for all deciles
   - NYSE shows particularly strong significance in the extreme deciles (0 and 9)

2. *Return Patterns*:
   - Both markets show evidence of momentum effect:
     - NYSE: Decile 0 (21.69%) and Decile 9 (20.73%)
     - NASDAQ: Decile 0 (29.01%) and Decile 9 (22.88%)
   - NASDAQ shows more extreme momentum returns:
     - Higher returns in the top decile
     - Larger spread between extreme deciles
     - This suggests momentum effects are stronger in NASDAQ stocks, which feels intuitive because the nasdaq has more growth stocks.

3. *Comparison*:
   - NASDAQ has generally higher returns across deciles
   - The spread between extreme deciles is:
     - NYSE: ~0.957% (21.69% - 20.73%)
     - NASDAQ: ~6.13% (29.01% - 22.88%)
   - This suggests momentum strategies might be more profitable in NASDAQ stocks

4. *Economic Significance*:
   - The returns are economically meaningful
   - Monthly returns of 2-3% in extreme deciles suggest substantial investment opportunities
   - The effect is persistent across both markets

Problem 5. Potential concerns
#+end_quote

My first thoughts for the two biggest potential concerns were
1. Survivorship bias, I would guess that usually, such data would show us only the past values for stocks that are currently still there, so companies that went bankrupt won't be in here.
2. Are dividends, stock buybacks or stock splits considered in this dataset?
