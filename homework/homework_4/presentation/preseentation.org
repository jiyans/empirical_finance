*** Machine Learning in real estate
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Moving on to past research about machine learning in real estate
 - [cite:@hattori2019rent] use PCA to extract feature vectors from floorplans
   - They use it in various models
   - While they note slight improvements, they say that it is challenging to find merits for their improvements, because they are too small
 - [cite:@limsombunchai2004]
   - In this paper the authors argue for the usage of NN's in real-estate price prediction despite the hardships of their interpretation, simply due to their predictive power
   - They are using tabular data only
 - At the time of this writing we are not aware of any research using a Neural Netowrk trained with floor plan images for rental price predictions
#+END_NOTES

 - Earliest example we could find of research being done using NN's for rent price prediction is from 2004 [cite:@limsombunchai2004]
 - [cite/text/c:@hattori2019rent]  use Principal Component Analysis to extract feature vectors of floorplan data
#+begin_quote
[H]owever, the differences are not significant and it is difficult to find merits to use FPIs for rent prediction model. - [cite/text/cf:@hattori2019rent]
#+end_quote
 - [cite/text/cf:@zeng2019deep] use Computer Vision techniques for floorplans, to try detect the functionalities of the rooms
 - We have also found research using Computer Vision techniques for price estimation using photos of the interior and exteriors [cite:@poursaeed2018]
* Methodology
** Data
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - Snapshot of tabular and image data of real estate properties (2021 December)
 - Scraped from a real estate website
 - 140,000 observations, 3 categorical and 7 continuous features
 - Only include properties from the Tokyo Metropolitan area
    - Limit observations to Tokyo Metropolitan area to avoid having to deal with multiple markets
#+END_NOTES
 - Initial data set was scraped from a real estate website
 - Snapshot of tabular and image data of real estate properties
 - 140,000 observations, 3 categorical and 7 continuous features

** Neural Network
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Main talking points:
 - Currently, using a Resnet50
 - not state of the art, but its a relatively well researched model, that anyone can implement
   - We used a pretrained model
   - We freeze the pretrained layers, and only train the last layers for a few epochs
    - Afterwards we unfreeze the pretrained layers and train the whole model for a few more epochs
   - We used a sigmoid layer to scale the output of the NN to a predetermined range ( this is important for convergence )
#+END_NOTES

 - First we used a ~Resnet50~ architecture [cite:@he15:deep_resid_learn_image_recog]
 - Weights were initialized to pretrained weights available from ~torchvision~ [cite:@NEURIPS2019_9015]
 - Randomly initialized fully connected layers at the end of the usual ~Resnet50~ model
 - added a sigmoid "layer" to scale the outputs of the last layer into a predetermined range

*** Training
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - The reason the sigmoid layer is important is because of exploding gradients
 - In training the NN, we use the MSE loss function, which is the sum of the squared errors
 - Sometimes the NN will output a very high value, which will lead to a very high error
   - This will lead to a very high gradient, which will lead to a very large update to the weights
   - This will lead to the NN not converging
   - The sigmoid layer scales the output of the NN to a predetermined range, which prevents this from happening
 - The predetermined range is a very rough range  range of the rent prices in the dataset
#+END_NOTES
 - When training the Neural network we split the data into a train and test set.
 - The above splits were performed on the building level (as opposed to the apartment level)
 - This was done to make sure that the NN doesn't simply remember the style of floorplans of certain buildings
 - We fine-tuned the model as follows:
   - First we froze pretrained layers, trained for a 5 epochs (~1h per epoch)
   - Afterwards, unfroze them and trained the whole model for 10 epochs (~1h:30 per epoch)
 - The sigmoid layer was essential for the convergence of the model

** Augmentations
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - Depending on the model used, it is necessary to make all images the same size
 - There are different methods to do this, and the most popular ones are shown in this picture
 - The first two rows show the most popular methods
 - Recently the third method has also become more popular.
#+END_NOTES

#+CAPTION: This figure showcases the properties of each resizing method. The first and second rows compare nine floorplans. The third shows different crops of the leftmost floorplan.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
[[./assets/resizes.jpg]]
** Preprocessing of Images
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - We chose 224x224 because many image models use this size, we found that using bigger pictures gave better results
 - Cropping out of the image is done randomly as a augmentation technique
 - Image rotations were done at 90, 180, 270, 0 degree angles
 - We did not mirror the floorplans on purpose, as that would change the floorplans fundamentally ( Doors open the wrong ways, the compass shows the wrong direction )
#+END_NOTES
 - Normalization of images with normalization statistics of pretrained model
 - 2 augmentations
   - Randomly rotating the images
   - randomly cropping out a 224x224 square of the image
   - We did not mirror the floorplans on purpose, as that would change the floorplans fundamentally
* Results
** Quantitative
*** Models
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - Three regression models
   - Model 1: Regular Multiple Linear Regression using the tabular data
   - Model 2: Multiple Linear Regression using the tabular data and the output of the NN
   - Model 3: Neural Network only
 - We can see that the model using the NN factor outperforms the other two models on the train dataset
 - Note that we hid the categorical variables, because there is just so many of them
 -

 - The rsquared on the test dataset improved by quite a margin.

|--------------------------------------+---------+---------+---------|
 - We can see an improvement on the total dataset  \( R^2: 0.915 \rightarrow 0.945 \)
 - test data improvement is smaller \( R^2: 0.914 \rightarrow 0.923 \)

*** Performance
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - In fact the prediction error on the test dataset was reduced by 26%
 - 438,130,000−321,310,000=116,820,000
 - over a 100M Yen improvement in prediction per month

 - \( 438,130,000 - 321,310,000  = 116,820,000 \)
 - \( 116,820,000 \) Yen improvement in prediction
** Qualitative
*** Randomly Extracted sample
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - Randomly extracted sample
 - Floorplan; left above is the prediction, right above is the true value
 - This doesn't tell us too much, so lets look at some more extreme predictions
 - First we will look the lowest predictions of the model
#+END_NOTES

[[./assets/random_table.png]]

*** Lowest predictions of the neural net
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - All of the lowest predictions are dormitories or shared houses
 - The model probably picked up on the fact that these floorplans have a repetitive nature
 - This is likely why the model predicts a low rent for these types of apartments
#+END_NOTES

#+CAPTION: The four predictions the model predicted the lowest rent for. (in 10,000¥)
[[./assets/rand_neg_top_100.png]]

*** Highest predictions of the neural net
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - Highest predictions of the neural net
 - These floorplans are all very large
   - Have multiple floors to them
   - Have multiple bedrooms
   - Have quite intricate layouts
 - The magnitude error is quite high. It is not overpredicting slightly, but by a large margin
#+END_NOTES

*** Plot of residuals
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - Residual plot
 - Blue dotted line is drawn at the 100 万円 mark
 - Left is of model with NN
 - Middle is just the NN
 - Right is the regression including NN
 - We can see that overall the predictions become better
 - Left model has a lot of very high predictions
 - NN doesn't have those kinds of predictions, but has a lot of mistakes for the lower rent apartments
 - Right model kind accounts for the weaknesses of the two other models and nicely balances them out
